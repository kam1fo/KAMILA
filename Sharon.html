         Sharon Marie Tate Polanski (January 24, 1943 â€“ August 9, 1969) was an American actress and model. During the 1960s, she played small television roles before appearing in films and was regularly featured in fashion magazines as a model and cover girl. After receiving positive reviews for her comedic and dramatic acting performances, Tate was hailed as one of Hollywood's most promising newcomers.

         Tate made her film debut in 1961 as an extra in Barabbas with Anthony Quinn. She was next seen in 1966 with the occult-themed Eye of the Devil. Her most remembered performance was as Jennifer North in the 1967 cult classic film Valley of the Dolls, earning her a Golden Globe Award nomination. That year she also performed in the film The Fearless Vampire Killers directed by her future husband Roman Polanski. Tate's last completed film, 12+1, was released posthumously in 1969.
         
         On August 9, 1969, Tate and four others were murdered by members of the Manson Family in the home she shared with her husband. At the time of her death, she was eight-and-a-half months pregnant
